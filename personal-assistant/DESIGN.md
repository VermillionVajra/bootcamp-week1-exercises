The basic function of our personal assistant should be to handle a list of to-dos, update them accordingly, have a field for typed user input (show relevant substring results), and options to resolve/delete/add items. What would these consist of component-wise? 

    1. Add todo (button or enter-press on the field)
    2. Delete todo (button)
    3. Complete todo (button)
    4. Input field for search

    ------DISPLAY------
    1. Show completed todos
    2. Show todos remaining

    ------FUNCTIONS------
    1. Be able to remove [all] todos
    2. Be able to search/filter by substring
    3. Manage multiple todo lists (add + remove + merge)?
    4. View lists
